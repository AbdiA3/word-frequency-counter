I trust that you also noticed that Tom riddle was already highly self-sufficient ,secretive and, apparently, friendless? He did not want help on companionship on his trip to diagon Alley. He preferred to operate alone. The adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming that they are in in his confidence,that they alone are close to him, even understand him. They are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.
